# Pension

This project is to monitor the value of a NEST pension. 

The script will:
1- Open a browser and navigate to the NEST pension website
2- Login as a specified user
3- Obtain the current value of the pension pot, including the "Number of units", "Unit Price" and "Fund value"
4- These values are then passed into a webhook to be recorded in a spreadsheet
